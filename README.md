# MobileChecker
Rewrite Mobile Checker with React Native

To fulfill one of the requirements to get a certificate from Hacktiv8 course.
I rewrote the Mobile Checker apps that used by the operational team at Container Depot, which previously used Java and now I write using React Native.

Rewritten feature:
1. Login
2. Home
3. Container In
4. Set Location of the Container
5. Logout

For demonstrations and simulations please use the following login:
Username: tester
Password: 123

Thanks.
