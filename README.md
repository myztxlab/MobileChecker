# MobileChecker
Rewrite Mobile Checker with React Native

To fulfill one of the requirements to get a certificate from hacktiv8 course.
I rewrote the Mobile Checker program that used by operational team in Container Depot, which previously used Java and now I write using React Native.

Rewritten features:
1. Login
2. Home
3. Container In
4. Set Location Container
5. Logout

For demonstration and simulation please use the following login:
